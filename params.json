{"name":"Lightbulb","tagline":"Chat with people and stuff","body":"### Welcome to Lightbulb\r\nLightbulb is an instant messenger for Symbian based on [MeegIM](https://projects.developer.nokia.com/meegim) and licensed on GPL 3 license. It is written using Symbian C++, Qt and QtQuick. Also uses qxmpp library for XMPP support.\r\nBtw. it's pretty cool and you can use it to chat with people and stuff!\r\n\r\n### Why would I need this anyway?\r\nLightbulb IM can be used for Google Talk/Hangouts, Facebook Chat and is compatible with probably any XMPP server. It's beautiful and should handle your text messages correctly. Wanna use it for something else than XMPP? You should familiarize yourself with transports. I use it for Gadu-Gadu myself. :)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCore developer of this software is @ksiazkowicz. This piece of code reuses some bits and pieces from Tweetian app by @dicksonleong and was coded with some very useful help and support from @huellif (we actually had to go through some poorly docummented Symbian APIs). \r\n\r\n### Where to get it?\r\nYou can get latest releases from my GitHub, [here](https://github.com/ksiazkowicz/lightbulb/releases) or from [Symbian Store](http://symbianstore.symbian-developers.net).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
